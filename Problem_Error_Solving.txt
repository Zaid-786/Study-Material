problem: Uncaught SyntaxError: import declarations may only appear at top level of a module

solved=>  
    	  1) It is still experimental on Firefox (from v54): You have to set to true the variable 		    	dom.moduleScripts.enabled in about:config
	    search on browser and put on there  about:config
	    
	 
	  2) Add type="module" to your script tag where you import the js file
	       <script type="module" src="appthatimports.js"></script>

	 
	  3) Import files have to be prefixed (./, /, ../ or http:// before)
	 	 import * from "./mylib.js"
		
		note:- you should write extension with file which files you are imported
